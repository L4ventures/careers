##Senior Software Engineer

**Ethereum needs scaling solutions.** At L4, you’re going to help build them.

We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to work on [Counterfactual](http://counterfactual.com/), our framework for generalized state channels. Our technique lets developers build dapps that use as few on-chain operations as possible, making them cheaper, and giving users instant web-like response time. Working closely with leading cryptoeconomic researchers, you will put cutting-edge theory into practice by building this critical scaling solution.

At L4, we’re building for the long term. Counterfactual is essential infrastructure for the decentralized internet. We’re here to write code that will be used by billions of people and applications, supporting a new open-source financial system built on ethereum. If you want to join us on that journey, get in touch. 

##About you:

**You’re intellectually curious.** Every day we are working on creative solutions to difficult problems in a new interdisciplinary field. Our team is motivated not just by building great things, but by discovering new ideas and pushing the state of the art forward.

**You’re motivated to solve huge problems.** The challenges we’re tackling are massive and critical. Without near-term scaling solutions like generalized state channels, decentralized technologies may never reach their full potential. When we succeed, your code will form part of the world’s critical economic infrastructure.

**You’re able to learn quickly and integrate disciplines.** Working on cutting edge problems in a new field means constantly learning, saying fresh, and collecting insights and ideas from many different sources. Your ability to learn quickly is more important than your pre-existing knowledge of blockchain tech.

**You’re passionate about defining standards and building great APIs.** At L4, you will create the open-source abstractions that will help thousands of developers integrate state channels into their applications.

##The problems you’ll be working on

*Translating bleeding-edge research on consensus mechanisms into developer friendly APIs and tooling for use in production-quality decentralized applications. More than just functional, these will have to be robust, simple, and extensible.
*Implementing techniques for general state channel modules to be incorporated in the design of web, mobile, and hardware wallets.
*Coordinating with the blockchain community to design, propose, and adopt interoperable standards across blockchains for state channel designs.
